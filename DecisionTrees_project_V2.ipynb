    "Home valuation is key in real estate industry, and also the basis for mortgages in credit sector. Here we have to predict the estimated value of a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data (*Regression_Supervised_Train_reduced.csv*) consist of a list of features plus the resulting $parcelvalue$, described in *Case_data_dictionary.xlsx* file. Each row corresponds to a particular home valuation, and $transactiondate$ is the date when the property was effectively sold. Properties are defined by $lotid$, but be aware that one property can be sold more than once (it's not the usual case). Also notice that some features are sometime empty, your model has to deal with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you don't have to use $totaltaxvalue$, $buildvalue$ or $landvalue$, because they are closely correlated with the final value to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Using this data build a predictive model for $parcelvalue$. Should be one belonging to the decision trees family of models (random forest, adaboost, gbm, xgboost, etc.).\n",
    "+ Try a first quick implementation, then try to optimize hyperparameters\n",
    "+ If you have computational problems, try in-class a first version with half of the observations. Remember to paralellize when possible (*n_jobs* parameter).\n",
    "+ For this analysis there is an extra test dataset. Once your code is submitted we will run a competition to see how you score in the test data. Hence have prepared also the necessary script to compute the MSE estimate on the test data once released.\n",
    "+ Bonus: Try an approach to fill NA without removing features or observations, and check improvements.\n",
    "+ Extra bonus: Try to do a final model that as an ensemble of different decision trees models (e.g. random forest, xgboost, GBM ...), and even including models from another families (SVM, kNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow those **steps** in your first implementation:\n",
    "1. *Explore* and understand the dataset. Report missing data\n",
    "2. As a simplified initial version, get rid of *missing data* by:\n",
    "    + Removing features that have more than 40% of missing data\n",
    "    + After that, removing observations that have missing data\n",
    "3. Create *dummy variables* for relevant categorical features\n",
    "4. *Build* your model and test it on the same input data.\n",
    "5. Assess expected accuracy using *cross-validation*\n",
    "6. Try to assess variable *importance*\n",
    "7. Prepare the code to *run* on a new input file and be able to report accuracy, following same preparation steps (missing data, dummies, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to iterate to refine some of these steps once you get performance results in step 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**: Please, to proceed to step 7, first *dump* your model to a file, and load it again from there. Then, remember to share with me not only the notebook, but also the dump file. Here you have an example using package *pickle*.\n",

    "Some comments\n",
    "+ Better if you do GridSearchCV to tune a bit more\n",
    "+ Maybe worth to check if it'f better to predict log(y), and then report accuracy on y.\n",
    "+ If you observe overfitting, you can use regularization parameters in xgboost.\n",
    "+ For the final version, use different models and build ensemble, also play with propagating some of the input features. Also rethink the categorical variables and try other things than dummify if number of unique values is high.\n",
    "+ To fill NA, don't use dropna as you do, better use SingleImputer to most of the columns, or even better use IterativeImputer"
